// The onDelete: Cascade directive in Prisma indicates that when a parent record is deleted, all its 
// related child records will also be automatically deleted
// If a User is deleted, all Messages associated with that user will also be deleted.
// If a Chatroom is deleted, all Messages associated with that chatroom will also be deleted.
// In short, it ensures data integrity by automatically removing related records to prevent orphaned entries
